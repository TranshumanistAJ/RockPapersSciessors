# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
## **Overview**

The Rock-Paper-Scissors game is a Python-based version of the classic hand game. In this iteration, the user plays against the computer in a turn-based competition where the objective is to win the most rounds by selecting rock, paper, or scissors. The game is played in a terminal and provides a simple, yet engaging user experience.

The user and the computer each choose one of the three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The game uses Python‚Äôs `random` module to generate the computer‚Äôs choice, ensuring an unpredictable and fair competition. The player takes turns with the computer, and the result of each round is displayed immediately. The game continues until the player decides to stop, with scores tracked and displayed after each round.

The game features a text-based interface that guides the user through the various stages of the game. The user is prompted to enter their name, which is then used throughout the game for a personalized experience. Instructions and rules are clearly presented before the game begins, ensuring that even those unfamiliar with the classic game can quickly understand how to play.

The game leverages Python functions, loops, and conditionals to achieve the desired outcome. The player's and computer's choices are compared, and the winner is determined based on the classic rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors: rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock. The player‚Äôs score and the computer‚Äôs score are tracked globally, and the user can reset scores at any time.

Upon completion of each round, the player is presented with the option to play again or return to the main menu. The game is designed to provide a fun and engaging experience, making it a perfect quick-play game or a distraction during breaks.

This project serves as an excellent example of using Python for game development, showcasing the use of functions, loops, and conditionals in a real-world application. It also highlights the potential for extending terminal-based applications with additional features and enhancements.


## Features include:

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-navigate menu options to start the game, view rules, reset scores, or exit the application.

- **Personalization**: Players are prompted to enter their name for a personalized experience.

- **Flexible Input**: Supports both full word inputs (rock, paper, scissors) and abbreviations (r, p, s) for ease of use.

- **Dynamic Score Tracking**: Continuously tracks and displays scores of both the player and the computer.

- **Replayability**: Players can play multiple rounds and return to the main menu at any time.

- **Randomized Choices**: The computer's choices are randomized using Python's random module, ensuring a fair and unpredictable game.

## Deployment on Heroku:
I have tested the game on Heroku and found no errors.
The test can be found [here](https://my-rock-paper-scissors-game-c4426078589d.herokuapp.com/)
### Data Model:
##### The game operates with several functions different managing aspects:

- **print_logo()**: Displays the game's ASCII art logo.
- **show_rules()**: Displays the rules of the game.
- **main_menu()**: Handles the main menu interactions.
- **get_user_choice()**: Validates and processes the user's input.
- **get_computer_choice()**: Randomly selects the computer's choice.
- **determine_winner()**: Compares choices and determines the winner.
- **reset_scores()**: Resets both the user's and computer's scores.
- **play_game()**: Manages the game loop, user input, and score updates.

### Start screen
![start-screen](images/zero-ask-for-a-number.jpeg)
- At the very beginning, the game is displayed showing the main menu. Each option is numbered. The player has the choice to choose for e.g ("1") to play the game or any of the other options.

![second-screenshot](images/one-and-askname.jpeg)
- The player chooses to start the game. The game would then ask the player to enter a name to represent the player for the duration of the game.

![third-screenshot](images/two-askforletter.jpeg)
- The game would then ask the player to choose one of the three options ( rock, paper, or sciessors) whether as full words or just the first letter of the words ( e.g. The player can simply choose "r" and the game would recognize this as "rock". The player can also choose to write the full word "rock" and it will serve the same purpose)

![screenshot-decision](images/three-it-is-atie-and-for-y-n.jpeg)
- If the player chooses for e.g. "s" which represents "sciessors", and the computer chooses the same option, then it shows a "tie" and the game continues without adding any points to the player nor the computer.
The game continues by asking the player whether they want to continue by choosing "y" which represents "yes" or "n" which represents "no". If the player decides to press "y" then the game continues.

![screenshot-player-wins](images/four-plyer-win-count-continue.jpeg)
- This screenshots highlights the incident if the player wins by choosing "rock" and the computer "sciessors" then it declares the player the winner, and adds plus one to the score for the player. The game would then ask the player if they want to continue.

![screenshot](images/computer-wins-randomness.png)
- This screenshot highlights the incident when the computer wins ensuring the randomness of the process when it comes to choosing one of the three options.

![screenshot-reset](images/seven-reset-score.png)
- If the player chooses "n" which represents "no" not to continue, and decides to reset the score then the player would choose number three from the main menu aand the score will be reset.

![screenshot-invalid](images/invalid-number.png)
- If the player decides to play again but decides to choose "5" from the list which is invalid since there are only the options from 1 to 4 then the game would note the player that they have chosen an invalid number and ought to choose a correct number.

![screenshot-show-rules](images/five-show-rules.jpeg)
- This screenshot highlights the incident when the player wants to know the rules of the game. Number three when chosen, it will show the rules of the game and which option is stronger than the other. There were three sentences to demonstrate that.

### **Future Enhancements**:
 ####  There are several areas with scope for future improvement. This project has been very challenging, and ultimately the project deadline was looming. I would have liked to add the following:
- Adding a player vs player option.
- The option of skipping the rules for returning players.
- The option to randomly choose the computer's selection for quicker games.
- An option to have different difficulty levels with varying randomness or predictability of the computer's choices.
____
