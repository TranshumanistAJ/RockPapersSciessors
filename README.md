# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
## Overview
The Rock-Paper-Scissors game is a Python-based version of the classic hand game. In this iteration, the user plays against the computer in a turn-based competition where the objective is to win the most rounds by selecting rock, paper, or scissors. The game is played in a terminal and provides a simple, yet engaging user experience.

module to generate the computer's choice, ensuring an unpredictable and fair competition. The player takes turns with the computer, and the resultThe user and the computer each choose one of the three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The game uses Python's random module to generate the computer's choice, ensuring an unpredictable and fair competition. The player takes turns with the computer, and the result of each round is displayed immediately. The game continues until the player decides to stop, with scores tracked and displayed after each round.

The game features a text-based interface that guides the user through the various stages of the game. The user is prompted to enter their name, which is then used throughout the game for a personalized experience. Instructions and rules are clearly presented before the game begins, ensuring that even those unfamiliar with the classic game can quickly understand how to play.

The game leverages Python functions, loops, and conditionals to achieve the desired outcome. The player's and computer's choices are compared, and the winner is determined based on the classic rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors: rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock. The player's score and the computer's score are tracked globally, and the user can reset scores at any time.

Upon completion of each round, the player is presented with the option to play again or return to the main menu. The game is designed to provide a fun and engaging experience, making it a perfect quick-play game or a distraction during breaks.

This project serves as an excellent example of using Python for game development, showing the use of functions, loops, and conditionals in a real-world application. It also highlights the potential for extending terminal-based applications with additional features and enhancements.

### Features include:

- User-Friendly Interface : Easy-to-navigate menu options to start the game, view rules, reset scores, or exit the application.

- Personalization : Players are prompted to enter their name for a personalized experience.

- Flexible Input : Supports both full word inputs (rock, paper, scissors) and abbreviations (r, p, s) for ease of use.

- Dynamic Score Tracking : Continuously tracks and displays scores of both the player and the computer.

- Replayability : Players can play multiple rounds and return to the main menu at any time.

- Randomized Choices : The computer's choices are randomized using Python's random module, ensuring a fair and unpredictable game.

### **Future Enhancements**:
 ####  There are several areas with scope for future improvement. This project has been very challenging, and ultimately the project deadline was looming. I would have liked to add the following:
- Adding a player vs player option.
- The option of skipping the rules for returning players.
- The option to randomly choose the computer's selection for quicker games.
- An option to have different difficulty levels with varying randomness or predictability of the computer's choices.
