# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
### Overview:
The Rock-Paper-Scissors game is a classic hand game brought to life through a terminal-based Python application. This project aims to offer a quick, fun, and interactive gaming experience where users can challenge the computer in a series of rounds to determine the ultimate winner.

### Features include:

- User-Friendly Interface : Easy-to-navigate menu options to start the game, view rules, reset scores, or exit the application.

- Personalization : Players are prompted to enter their name for a personalized experience.

- Flexible Input : Supports both full word inputs (rock, paper, scissors) and abbreviations (r, p, s) for ease of use.

- Dynamic Score Tracking : Continuously tracks and displays scores of both the player and the computer.

- Replayability : Players can play multiple rounds and return to the main menu at any time.

- Randomized Choices : The computer's choices are randomized using Python's random module, ensuring a fair and unpredictable game.

### **Future Enhancements**:
 ####  There are several areas with scope for future improvement. This project has been very challenging, and ultimately the project deadline was looming. I would have liked to add the following:
- Adding a player vs player option.
- The option of skipping the rules for returning players.
- The option to randomly choose the computer's selection for quicker games.
- An option to have different difficulty levels with varying randomness or predictability of the computer's choices.
